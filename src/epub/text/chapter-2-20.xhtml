			<p>“It is now the twenty-eighth of April; he said that he should be through by the first of July. Let us say the tenth; but that is not the first. Well, we can take the tenth; or, so as to get nearer, I’ll suppose it’s the fifteenth. No, I’ll take the tenth, after all. Now, how many days are left? To-day should not be counted; there are only five hours of it left. There are two days more in April; May, thirty-one, and two make thirty-three; June, thirty, and thirty-three makes sixty-three; in July ten days; altogether it makes seventy-three. Is that much? Only seventy-three days, and then⁠—freedom! I shall get out of this cellar. <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Akh!</i> how happy I am! My <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">mílenki</i>! how cleverly he thought it all out! How happy I am!”</p>
			<p>This was on Sunday evening. On Monday came a lesson given instead of Tuesday.</p>
			<p>“My dear, my beloved!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a> how glad I am to be with you, if only for a minute! Do you know how many days there are left for me to be in this cellar? When will you be done? Will you be done by the tenth of July?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Viérotchka.”</p>
			<p>“Then I shall have to sit in this cellar only seventy-two days and this evening. One day I have marked off already. See I have made a little calendar just as boarding-school girls and boys do, and I cross off the days. How delightful it is to cross them off!”</p>
			<p>“My dear little Viérotchka, my dear!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-17" id="noteref-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a> Indeed, you have not long to worry along here; two months and a half will quickly pass, and you will be free.”</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Akh!</i> how delightful it will be! Only just at present, my dearest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a> don’t always talk with me, and don’t look at me; and we must not play on the piano every time you come, either. And I shall not come out of my room every time that you come here; no, I shall not have enough strength of mind for that. I shall come out always, if only for one minute; and I shall look at you so coldly; not fondly at all. And now I am going right away to my room. Good by, my dear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a> When?”</p>
			<p>“Thursday.”</p>
			<p>“Three days; how long! But then there will be only sixty-eight days left.”</p>
			<p>“Count less; about the seventh you will be able to get away from here.”</p>
			<p>“The seventh? Then it is now only sixty-eight days. How happy you have made me! Good by, my dear.”</p>
			<p>Thursday.⁠—“My dearest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-20" id="noteref-20" epub:type="noteref">20</a> there are only sixty-six days to stay here.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Viérotchka; the time flies fast.” “Fast? No, my dear. <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Akh!</i> how long the days seem! Sometimes it seemed to me as though a whole month had dragged along while these three days were passing. Good by, my dearest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a> we must not talk long; aren’t we shrewd? yes? Good by. <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Akh!</i> only sixty-six remain for me to sit in the cellar.⁠—Hm! hm! it is not so noticeable, of course; when one is at work, time flies. And then I am not in a cellar. Hm! hm! <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">da!</i>”</p>
			<p><i>Saturday</i>.⁠—”<i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Akh!</i> my dearest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a> only sixty-four days are left. <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Akh!</i> how gloomy it is here! These two days have seemed longer than those three days. <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Akh!</i> how gloomy! How miserable it is here; if you only realized it, my dear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23" epub:type="noteref">23</a> Good by, my dear, my sweetheart,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a> till Tuesday; and these three days will seem longer than the last five. Good by, my dear.⁠—Hm! hm! <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">da!</i> hm! her eyes look badly. She does not like to weep. This is not well. Hm! <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">da!</i>”</p>
			<p><i>Tuesday</i>.⁠—”<i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Akh!</i> my dearest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-25" id="noteref-25" epub:type="noteref">25</a> I gave up counting the days. They don’t pass⁠—they don’t pass at all.”</p>
			<p>“Viérotchka, my little friend, I have a favor to ask of you. We must have a nice little talk together. You are anxiously longing for freedom. Well, give yourself a little freedom; we must have a talk together.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, we must, <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">moï mílenki</i>, we must.”</p>
			<p>“Then I will ask you how this suits you. What time will it be most convenient for you to-morrow; it does not make the least difference what time, only tell me; be again on that bench of the Konno-Gvardiesky Boulevard. Will you?”</p>
			<p>“I will be there, <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">moï mílenki</i>, without fail. At eleven o’clock; is that right?”</p>
			<p>“Very well; thank you, little friend.”</p>
			<p>“Good by, my dearest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a> <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Akh!</i> how glad I am that you have thought about it! How was it that I, myself, foolish little thing that I am, did not think about it? Good by. We will talk; at all events, I shall breathe the fresh air. Good by, <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">mílenki</i>. At eleven o’clock, without fail.”</p>
			<p>Friday.⁠—“Viérotchka, where are you going?”</p>
			<p>“I, <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">mámenka</i>?”</p>
			<p>Viérotchka blushed.</p>
			<p>“To the Nevsky Prospekt, <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">mámenka</i>.”</p>
			<p>“Then I am going with you, Viérotchka; I have an errand at the Gostinui Dvor. What did you put on such a dress as that for, Viérotchka, when you say you are going to the Nevsky. You ought to put on a better one when you are going to the Nevsky; folks’ll see you.”</p>
			<p>“I like this dress. Just wait one second, <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">mámenka</i>; I want to get just one thing out of my room.”</p>
			<p>They start; they go. They reached the Gostinui Dvor. They were going along the block that runs parallel with Sadovaïa Street; they are not far from the Nevsky corner, and here is Ruzanof’s shop.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Mámenka</i>, I have two words to tell you.”</p>
			<p>“What is the matter with you, Viérotchka?”</p>
			<p>“Good by, <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">mámenka</i>. I don’t know whether we shall meet again soon. If you don’t get angry, it’ll be to-morrow.”</p>
			<p>“What is it, Viérotchka? I cannot understand it, somehow?”</p>
			<p>“Good by, <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">mámenka</i>; I am going to my husband. Dmitri Sergéitch and I were married three days ago. Drive to Karavannaïa Street, Izvoshchik.”</p>
			<p>“A quarter, lady.”</p>
			<p>“All right; only be quick about it. He will call upon you this evening, <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">mámenka</i>; and don’t get angry with me, <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">mámenka</i>.”</p>
			<p>These words hardly reached Marya Alekséyevna’s ears.</p>
			<p>“Don’t drive to Karavannaïa Street; I only said so as to get away from that lady as quickly as I could. Go to the left<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a> down Nevsky. I must go much further than Karavannaïa Street, to the Vasilyevsky Island, the fifth block behind the Middle Prospekt. Drive fast; I will give you a good fee.”</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="ru-Latn">Akh!</i> lady, you were pleased to fool me. You’ll have to give me half a ruble.”</p>
			<p>“If you drive fast.”</p>
