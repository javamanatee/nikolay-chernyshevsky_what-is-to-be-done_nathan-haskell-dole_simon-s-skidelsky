			<p>There was still more riotous conduct during the evening; but when order was restored, Beaumont, by the request of his new acquaintance, began to tell the story of his life after he came to the United States.</p>
			<p>“As soon as I got there,” said he, “I took pains to become naturalized. For that purpose, I had to make friends with some party. What do you suppose it was? Naturally, the Abolitionists. I wrote several articles for the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Tribune</i> about the influence of slavery upon the whole state of society in Russia. This, a new argument, was not a bad one, for the Abolitionists to use against slavery in the Southern States, and I became a citizen of Massachusetts. Soon after my arrival, I found a position in the office of one of the few large firms belonging to that party in New York.” Further, he told them the same story which we already know. At least, this part of Beaumont’s biography cannot be doubted.</p>
